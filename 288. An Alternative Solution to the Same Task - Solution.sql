# Exercise #1:
# Use a CTE (a Common Table Expression) and a SUM() function in the SELECT statement in a query to find out how 
# many male employees have never signed a contract with a salary value higher than or equal to the all-time 
# company salary average:

WITH cte_DS2 AS (SELECT AVG(salary) AS Average_Salary FROM employees.salaries)
SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN s.salary < c.Average_Salary THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_male_salaries_below_average_w_sum,
COUNT(s.salary) AS total_of_salary_contracts
FROM
employees.salaries s
INNER JOIN
employees.employees e ON s.emp_no = e.emp_no AND e.gender = 'M'
CROSS JOIN

# Jawapan daripada Solution:
